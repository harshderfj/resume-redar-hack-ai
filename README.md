# Resume Radar - Powered by Fetch.ai

## Introduction
Resume Radar is an innovative tool developed for the IIT Bombay HACKAI hackathon, sponsored by Fetch.ai. It uses Fetch.ai agents and a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face for analyzing resumes and job descriptions, providing a detailed evaluation of candidate skills.

## Key Features
- *Fetch.ai Integration*: Leverages Fetch.ai agents for REST API requests.
- *BERT Model Analysis*: Utilizes a BERT model for text processing and similarity calculations.
- *Skill Categorization*: Classifies skills into Project Management, Backend, Frontend, Data Science, and DevOps.
- *Visual Skill Representation*: Offers a pie chart for visualizing skill distribution.
- *Skill Gap Analysis*: Identifies missing skills in a resume compared to a job description.
- *Similarity Scoring*: Uses BERT model to score the similarity between a resume and job description.

## Technology Stack
- Flask, PyPDF2, NLTK, Transformers, Pandas, Matplotlib.
- Fetch.ai agents for backend operations.
- BERT tokenizer and model for text analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later.

## Installation
Clone the repository and set up the Flask environment:
```bash
$ cd resume-screening-flask
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ flask run


## Usage
- *Upload Files*: Upload resumes and job descriptions in PDF format. Files are stored in the uploads folder.
- *Analysis*: The application processes and analyzes the text from the uploaded files.
- *Visualization*: View the skill distribution in a pie chart.
- *Skill Gap and Recommendations*: Identify missing skills and get recommendations for improvement.

## Security and Privacy
- The uploads folder is hidden and private, ensuring data confidentiality.
- A unique private key is generated for each Fetch.ai agent, enhancing security and integrity.

## Conclusion
Resume Radar demonstrates the effective use of AI and NLP in recruitment, backed by Fetch.ai's robust and scalable technology.
